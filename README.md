# PokeShop

During my internship program on Anadolu Hayat Emeklilik A.Ş, to make it easier for me to get used to SwiftUI technology, I've made a Pokemon Shop application where the user add Pokemons to cart, in addition user can view Pokemon Details, Prices, Categories, Descriptions...etc.

## Features

- With user related UI design. ✅
- Getting different images for different resolution devices with responsive screen design. ✅
- Application has high testability and readability with MVVM. ✅
- Rest Api operations are done using URLSession. ✅
- With the KingFisher & SDWebImageSwiftUI library, the images are kept in the cache and the loading of the images is made easier. ✅
- Repeated code blocks recommended for clean coding are combined in flexible methods. ✅
- Care was taken to ensure that in-app method and variable naming are in English and comprehensible. ✅
- User interaction supported with pop-up dynamic texted alerts. ✅
